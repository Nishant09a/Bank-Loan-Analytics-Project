Problem Statement:
Despite a healthy and growing loan portfolio with a high repayment rate and low delinquency rate, the bank faces several challenges:
Lack of diversification: The bank's loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in the commercial sector (51%). This concentration exposes the bank to increased risk if the commercial sector experiences a downturn.
Limited product offerings: The bank primarily offers traditional loan products, such as commercial and residential loans. This limits the bank's ability to attract new customers and grow its market share.
Emerging opportunities: The bank is not actively pursuing emerging opportunities in high-growth industries, such as renewable energy and healthcare. This limits the bank's potential for future growth.
These challenges could potentially lead to:
Reduced profitability
Increased risk exposure
Missed market opportunities
The bank needs to implement strategies to address these challenges and ensure its long-term financial sustainability.
